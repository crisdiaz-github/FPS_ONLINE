# FPS_ONLINE
This project is from my last year in my Higher education studies, the objective was learn how to work with the **Photon Engine** tools for Unity, make a fun multiplayer fps and a app for android that is linked with the user u created ingame for a lootbox opening mechanic.

It was a group project, my classmate did the art and i did the programming. 

**The server which the game sessions and accounts were assigned is not active anymore.**
